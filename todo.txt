- Have to streamline pushing to fresh coordinates whenever a candidate changes
- Easy puzzle doesnt seem to update y:0,x:6 to 9 even though it is a sole candidate

- More refactor
  - API for board
    - solve_cell
    - remove_candidates
  - Candidate struct?
    - obfuscates all this crazy bitmask stuff im doing
    - chaining of candidates
